# AWS-CICD-DevOps-Immersion-Day
In this workshop you'll learn how to build a CI/CD pipeline (AWS CodePipeline) to develop a web-based application, containerize it, and deploy it on a Amazon EKS cluster. You'll use the blue/green method to deploy application and review the switchover using Application Load Balancer (ALB) Target-groups. You will spawn this infrastructure using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), enabling you to reproduce the environment when needed, in relatively fewer lines of code.
